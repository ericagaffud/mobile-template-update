## Omnipay App to Ionic 7

Our project aims to upgrade an existing mobile application to the latest version of the Ionic framework, Ionic 7. The current application has been developed using an older version of Ionic and requires modernization to leverage the latest features, performance improvements, and security updates offered by Ionic 7. The upgraded application will offer a seamless user experience, enhanced performance, and better compatibility with various devices and platforms.
